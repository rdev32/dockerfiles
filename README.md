# Welcome

This repository contains a collection of Docker recipes designed to help you learn, build, and test your projects efficiently. Each recipe provides a step-by-step guide to setting up various services using Docker. If you find any of these recipes useful, please consider giving this project a star. Your support motivates me to create more resources and improve the existing ones.

## Available Recipes

- [PostgreSQL](./postgres.md)
- [MySQL](./mysql.md)
- [Microsoft SQL Server](./sqlserver.md)
- [MongoDB](./mongodb.md)
- [WordPress](./wordpress.md)
- [Odoo 17 Community](./odoo.md)

## Contributing

I plan to expand this repository with VSCode's dev containers and custom Dockerfiles to further enhance the learning experience. If youâ€™d like to contribute, feel free to submit a pull request with a well-crafted recipe. The current format includes a Docker Hub link as title, a brief description on what the recipee does, available arguments, and either a working command or a Docker Compose script as an example.
